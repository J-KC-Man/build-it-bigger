# build-it-bigger
An app with multiple flavors that uses multiple libraries and Google Cloud Endpoints. The finished app will consist of four modules. A Java library that provides jokes, a Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) project that serves those jokes, an Android Library containing an activity for displaying jokes, and an Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display.

Initial Project template provided by Udacity, recommended by them as a starting point for this project. Found at: https://github.com/udacity/ud867
